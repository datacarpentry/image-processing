The next series of episodes covers a basic toolkit of skimage operators. With 
these tools, we will be able to create programs to perform simple analyses of 
images based on changes in color or shape.

## Drawing on images

Often we wish to select only a portion of an image to analyze, and ignore the 
rest. Creating a rectangular sub-image with slicing, as we did in the 
[skimage Images]({{ page.root }}/03-skimage-images) lesson is one option for
simple cases. Another option is to create another special image, of the same 
size as the original, with white pixels indicating the region to save and
black pixels everywhere else. Such an image is called a *mask*. In preparing 
a mask, we sometimes need to be able to draw a shape -- a circle or a 
rectangle, say -- on a black image. skimage provides tools to do that. 

Consider this image of maize seedlings:

![Maize seedlings](../fig/03-maize-roots.jpg)

Now, suppose we want to analyze only the area of the image containing the roots
themselves; we do not care to look at the kernels, or anything else 
about the plants. Further, we wish to exclude the frame of the container holding
the seedlings as well. Exploration with ImageJ could tell us that the 
upper-left coordinate of the sub-area we are interested in is *(44, 357)*,
while the lower-right coordinate is *(720, 740)*. These coordinates are shown
in *(x, y)* order. 

A Python program to create a mask to select only that area of the image would
start with a now-familiar section of code to open and display the original
image. (Note that the display portion is used here for pedagogical purposes; it
 would probably not be used in production code.)

~~~
"""
 * Python program to use skimage drawing tools to create a mask.
 *
"""
import skimage
from skimage.viewer import ImageViewer
import numpy as np

# Load and display the original image
image = skimage.io.imread("maize-roots.tif")
viewer = ImageViewer(image)
viewer.show()
~~~
{: .python}

As before, we first import `skimage`. We also import the NumPy library, and give
it an alias of `np`. NumPy is necessary when we create the initial mask image,
and the alias saves us a little typing. Then, we load and display the initial
image in the same way we have done before.

NumPy allows indexing of images/arrays with "boolean" arrays of the same size.
Indexing with a boolean array is also called mask indexing. The "pixels" in such
a mask array can only take two values: `True` or `False`. When indexing an image
with such a mask, only pixel values at positions where the mask is `True` are
accessed. But first, we need to generate a mask array of the same size as the
image. Luckily, the NumPy library provides a function to create just such an
array. The next section of code shows how.

~~~
# Create the basic mask
mask = np.ones(shape=image.shape[0:2], dtype="bool")
~~~
{: .python}

We create the mask image with the 

`mask = np.ones(shape=image.shape[0:2], dtype="bool")`

function call. The first argument to the `ones()` function is the shape of 
the original image, so that our mask will be exactly the same size as the 
original. Notice, that we have only used the first two indices of our shape. We
omitted the channel dimension. Indexing with such a mask will change all channel
values simultaneously. The second argument, `dtype = "bool"`, indicates that the
elements in the array should be booleans -- i.e., values are either `True` or
`False`.

Next, we draw a filled, rectangle on the mask:

~~~
# Draw filled rectangle on the mask image
rr, cc = skimage.draw.rectangle(start=(357, 44), end=(740, 720))
mask[rr, cc] = False
~~~
{: .python}

The first parameter to the `rectangle()` function is the image to draw the rectangle on. The
next two parameters, `(357, 44)` and `(740, 720)`, are the coordinates of the 
upper-left and lower-right corners of the rectangle in *(y, x)* order.

The final section of the program displays the mask we just created:

~~~
# Display constructed mask
viewer = ImageViewer(mask)
viewer.show()
~~~
{: .python}

Here is what our constructed mask looks like:

## Image modification

All that remains is the task of modifying the image using our mask in such a
way that the areas with `True` pixels in the mask are not shown in the image
any more.

> ## How does a mask work?
> 
> Now, consider the mask image we created above. The values of the mask that 
> corresponds to the portion of the image we are interested in are all `False`,
> while the values of the mask that corresponds to the portion of the image we
> want to remove are all `True`. 
> 
> How do we change the original image using the mask?
> 
>> ## Solution
>> 
>> When indexing the image using the mask, we access only those pixels at
>> positions where the mask is `True`. So, when indexing with the mask, one
>> can set those values to 0, and effectively remove them from the image.
> {: .solution}
{: .challenge}

Now we can write a Python program to use a mask to retain only the portions
of our maize roots image that actually contains the seedling roots. We load the 
original image and create the mask in the same way as before:

~~~
"""
 * Python program to apply a mask to an image.
 *
"""
import numpy as np
import skimage
from skimage.viewer import ImageViewer

# Load the original image
image = skimage.io.imread("maize-roots.tif")

# Create the basic mask
mask = np.ones(shape=image.shape[0:2], dtype="bool")

# Draw a filled rectangle on the mask image
rr, cc = skimage.draw.rectangle(start=(357, 44), end=(740, 720))
mask[rr, cc] = False
~~~
{: .python}

Then, we use numpy indexing to remove the portions of the image, where the mask
is `True`:

~~~
# Apply the mask and display the result
image[mask] = 0
~~~
{: .python}

Then, we display the masked image.

~~~
viewer = ImageViewer(image)
viewer.show()
~~~
{: .python}

The resulting masked image should look like this:

![Applied mask](../fig/03-applied-mask.jpg)
