In this episode, we will learn how to use skimage functions to apply 
thresholding to an image. Thresholding is a type of *image segmentation*,
where we change the pixels of an image to make the image easier to 
analyze. In thresholding, we convert an image from color or grayscale into a 
*binary image*, i.e., one that is simply black and white. Most frequently, we 
use thresholding as a way to select areas of interest of an image, while 
ignoring the parts we are not concerned with. We have already done some simple 
thresholding, in the "Manipulating pixels" section of the 
[Skimage Images]({{ page.root }}/03-skimage-images/) episode. In that case, we
used a simple NumPy array manipulation to separate the pixels belonging to the
root system of a plant from the black background. In this episode, we will 
learn how to use skimage functions to perform thresholding. Then, we will use the
masks returned by these functions to select the parts of an image we are 
interested in. 

## Simple thresholding

Consider this image, with a series of crudely cut shapes set against a white 
background. The black outline around the image is not part of the image.

![Original shapes image](../fig/06-junk-before.jpg)

Now suppose we want to select only the shapes from the image. In other words,
we want to leave the pixels belonging to the shapes "on," while turning the 
rest of the pixels "off," by setting their color channel values to zeros. The
skimage library has several different methods of thresholding. We will start 
with the simplest version, which involves an important step of human 
input. Specifically, in this simple, *fixed-level thresholding*, we have to 
provide a threshold value, `t`.

The process works like this. First, we will load the original image, convert
it to grayscale, and blur it with one of the methods from the 
[Blurring]({{ page.root }}/06-blurring/) episode. Then, we will use the 
`>` operator to apply the threshold `t`, a number in the closed range [0.0, 1.0].
Pixels with color values on one 
side of `t` will be turned "on," while pixels with color values on the other side
will be turned "off." In order to use this function, we have to determine a good 
value for `t`. How might we do that? Well, one way is to look at a grayscale
histogram of the image. Here is the histogram produced by the 
**GrayscaleHistogram.py** program from the 
[Creating Histograms]({{ page.root }}/05-creating-histograms/) episode, if we
run it on the colored shapes image shown above.

![Grayscale histogram](../fig/06-junk-histogram.png)

Since the image has a white background, most of the pixels in the image are 
white. This corresponds nicely to what we see in the histogram: there is a
spike near the value of 1.0. If we want to select the shapes and not the
background, we want to turn off the white background pixels, while leaving the
pixels for the shapes turned on. So, we should choose a value of `t` somewhere
before the large peak and turn pixels above that value "off".

Here are the first few lines of a Python program to apply simple thresholding to the image, to 
accomplish this task. 

~~~
"""
 * Python script to demonstrate simple thresholding.
 *
 * usage: python Threshold.py <filename> <sigma> <threshold>
 * Example parameter values: 2 for sigma and .8 for threshold
"""
import sys
import numpy as np
import skimage.color
import skimage.filters
import skimage.io

# get filename, sigma, and threshold value from command line
filename = sys.argv[1]
my_sigma = float(sys.argv[2])
t = float(sys.argv[3])

# read and display the original image
image = skimage.io.imread(fname=filename)
skimage.io.imshow(image)
~~~
{: .python}

This program takes three command-line arguments: the filename of the image to 
manipulate, the sigma of the Gaussian used during the blurring step (which, if you recall
from the [Blurring]({{ page.root }}/06-blurring/) episode, must be a float),
and finally, the threshold value `t`, which should be a float in the closed
range [0.0, 1.0]. The program takes the command-line values and stores them in
variables named `filename`, `my_sigma`, and `t`, respectively.

Next, the program reads the original image based on the `filename` value, and
displays it. 

Now is where the main work of the program takes place. 

~~~
# blur and grayscale before thresholding
blur = skimage.color.rgb2gray(image)
blur = skimage.filters.gaussian(blur, sigma=sigma)
~~~
{: .python}

First, we convert the
image to grayscale and then blur it, using the `skimage.filter.gaussian()` function we
learned about in the [Blurring]({{ page.root }}/06-blurring/) episode.
We convert the input image to grayscale for easier thresholding.

The fixed-level thresholding is performed using numpy comparison operators.

~~~
# perform inverse binary thresholding
mask = blur < t
~~~
{: .python}

Here, we want to turn "on" all pixels which have values smaller than the threshold, 
so we use the `less operator <` to compare the blurred image `blur` to the threshold `t`.
The operator returns a binary image, that we capture in the variable `mask`.
It has only one channel, and each of its values is either 0 or 1. Here is a 
visualization of the binary image created by the thresholding operation.
The program used parameters of `sigma = 2` and `t = 0.8` to produce this image. You can
see that the areas where the shapes were in the original area are now white, 
while the rest of the mask image is black. 

![Mask created by thresholding](../fig/06-junk-mask.png)

We can now apply the mask to the original colored image as we have learned in the
[Drawing and Bitwise Operations]({{ page.root}}/04-drawing/) episode.

~~~
# use the mask to select the "interesting" part of the image
sel = np.zeros_like(image)
sel[mask] = image[mask]

# display the result
skimage.io.imshow(sel)
~~~
{: .python}

What we are left with is only the
colored shapes from the original, as shown in this image:

## Adaptive thresholding

There are also skimage methods to perform *adaptive thresholding*. The chief 
advantage of adaptive thresholding is that the value of the threshold, t, is
determined automatically for us. One such method, *Otsu's method*, is 
particularly useful for situations where the grayscale histogram of an image
has two peaks. Consider this maize root system image, which we have seen 
before in the [Skimage Images]({{ page.root }}/03-skimage-images/) episode.

![Maize root system](../fig/06-roots-original.jpg)

Now, look at the grayscale histogram of this image, as produced by our 
**GrayscaleHistogram.py** program from the 
[Creating Histograms]({{ page.root }}/05-creating-histograms/) episode. 

![Maize root histogram](../fig/06-roots-histogram.png)

The histogram has a significant peak around 0.2, and a second, albeit smaller
peak very near 1.0. Thus, this image is a good candidate for thresholding with
Otsu's method. The mathematical details of how this work are complicated (see 
the [skimage documentation](https://scikit-image.org/docs/dev/api/skimage.filters.html#threshold-otsu)
if you are interested), but the outcome is that Otsu's method finds a threshold
value between the two peaks of a grayscale histogram. 

The `skimage.filters.threshold_otsu()` function can be used to determine
the adaptive threshold via Otsu's method. Then numpy comparison operators can be
used to apply it as before.

Here is a Python program illustrating how to perform thresholding with Otsu's
method using the `skimage.filters.threshold_otsu` function. We start by reading and displaying
the target image.

~~~
"""
 * Python script to demonstrate adaptive thresholding using Otsu's method.
 *
 * usage: python AdaptiveThreshold.py <filename> <sigma>
"""
import sys
import numpy as np
import skimage.color
import skimage.filters
import skimage.io

# get filename and sigma value from command line
filename = sys.argv[1]
sigma = float(sys.argv[2])

# read and display the original image
image = skimage.io.imread(fname=filename)
skimage.io.imshow(image)
~~~
{: .python}

The program begins with the now-familiar imports and command line parameters. 
Here we only have to get the filename and the sigma of the Gaussian kernel from the command
line, since Otsu's method will automatically determine the thresholding value 
`t`. Then, the original image is read and displayed.

Next, a blurred grayscale image is created.

~~~
# blur and grayscale before thresholding
blur = skimage.color.rgb2gray(image)
blur = skimage.filters.gaussian(blur, sigma=sigma)
~~~
{: .python}

We determine the threshold via the `skimage.filters.threshold_otsu()` function:

~~~
# perform adaptive thresholding
t = skimage.filters.threshold_otsu(blur)
mask = blur > t
~~~
{: .python}

The function `skimage.filters.threshold_otsu()` uses Otsu's method to automatically
determine the threshold value based on its inputs grayscale histogram and returns it.
Then, we use the comparison operator `>` for binary thesholding. As we have seen before,
pixels above the threshold value will be turned on, those below the threshold will be turned off. 

For this root image, and a Gaussian blur with a sigma of 1.0,
the computed threshold value is 0.42, and the resulting mask is:

![Root system mask](../fig/06-roots-mask.png)

Next, we display the mask and use it to select the foreground

~~~
skimage.io.imshow(mask)

# use the mask to select the "interesting" part of the image
sel = np.zeros_like(image)
sel[mask] = image[mask]

# display the result
skimage.io.imshow(sel)
~~~
{: .python}

Here is the result:

![Masked root system](../fig/06-roots-selected.png)

## Application: measuring root mass

Let us now turn to an application where we can apply thresholding and other
techniques we have learned to this point. Consider these four maize root 
system images.

![Four root images](../fig/07-four-maize-roots.jpg)

Now suppose we are interested in the amount of plant material in each image, 
and in particular how that amount changes from image to image. Perhaps the 
images represent the growth of the plant over time, or perhaps the images show
four different maize varieties at the same phase of their growth. In any case,
the question we would like to answer is, "how much root mass is in each image?"
We will construct a Python program to measure this value for a single image, 
and then create a Bash script to execute the program on each trial image in 
turn. 

Our strategy will be this:

1. Read the image, converting it to grayscale as it is read. For this 
application we do not need the color image.
2. Blur the image.
3. Use Otsu's method of thresholding to create a binary image, where the pixels
that were part of the maize plant are white, and everything else is black.
4. Save the binary image so it can be examined later.
5. Count the white pixels in the binary image, and divide by the number of 
pixels in the image. This ratio will be a measure of the root mass of the 
plant in the image.
6. Output the name of the image processed and the root mass ratio. 

Here is a Python program to implement this root-mass-measuring strategy. Almost
all of the code should be familiar, and in fact, it may seem simpler than the
code we have worked on thus far, because we are not displaying any of the 
images with this program. Our program here is intended to run and produce its 
numeric result -- a measure of the root mass in the image -- without human 
intervention.

~~~
"""
 * Python program to determine root mass, as a ratio of pixels in the
 * root system to the number of pixels in the entire image.
 *
 * usage: python RootMass.py <filename> <sigma>
"""
import sys
import numpy as np
import skimage.io
import skimage.filters


# get filename and sigma value from command line
filename = sys.argv[1]
sigma = float(sys.argv[2])

# read the original image, converting to grayscale
img = skimage.io.imread(fname=filename, as_gray=True)
~~~
{: .python}

The program begins with the usual imports and reading of command-line 
parameters. Then, we read the original image, based on the filename parameter,
in grayscale. 

Next the grayscale image is blurred with a Gaussian that is defined by the sigma parameter.

~~~
# blur before thresholding
blur = skimage.filters.gaussian(img, sigma=sigma)
~~~
{: .python}

Following that, we create a binary image with Otsu's method for 
thresholding, just as we did in the previous section. Since the program is 
intended to produce numeric output, without a person shepherding it, it does
not display any of the images.

~~~
# perform adaptive thresholding to produce a binary image
t = skimage.filters.threshold_otsu(blur)
binary = blur > t
~~~
{: .python}

We do, however, want to save the binary images, in case we wish to examine them
at a later time. That is what this block of code does:
~~~
# save binary image; first find beginning of file extension
dot = filename.index(".")
binary_file_name = filename[:dot] + "-binary" + filename[dot:]
skimage.io.imsave(fname=binary_file_name, arr=skimage.img_as_ubyte(binary))
~~~
{: .python}

This code does a little bit of string manipulation to determine the filename 
to use when the binary image is saved. For example, if the input filename being
processed is **trial-020.jpg**, we want to save the corresponding binary image
as **trial-020-binary.jpg**. To do that, we first determine the index of the 
dot between the filename and extension -- and note that we assume that there is
only one dot in the filename! Once we have the location of the dot, we can use
slicing to pull apart the filename string, inserting "-binary" in between the
end of the original name and the extension. Then, the binary image is saved via
a call to the `skimage.io.imsave()` function. 
In order to convert from the binary range of 0 and 1 of the mask to a gray level image that can be saved as png, we use the `skimage.img_as_ubyte` utility function.

Finally, we can examine the code that is the reason this program exists! This
block of code determines the root mass ratio in the image:

~~~
# determine root mass ratio
rootPixels = np.count_nonzero(binary)
w = binary.shape[1]
h = binary.shape[0]
density = rootPixels / (w * h)

# output in format suitable for .csv
print(filename, density, sep=",")
~~~
{: .python}

Recall that we are working with a binary image at this point; every pixel in 
the image is either zero (black) or 1 (white). We want to count the number
of white pixels, which is easily accomplished with a call to the 
`np.count_nonzero` function. Then we determine the width and height of the
image, via the first and second elements of the image's `shape`. Then the
density ratio is calculated by dividing the number of white pixels by the 
total number of pixels in the image. Then, the program prints out the 
name of the file processed and the corresponding root density. 

If we run the program on the **trial-016.jpg** image, with a sigma value of 1.5,
we would execute the program this way:

~~~ 
python RootMass.py trial-016.jpg 1.5
~~~
{: .bash}

and the output we would see would be this:

~~~
trial-016.jpg,0.0482436835106383
~~~
{: .output}

We have four images to process in this example, and in a real-world scientific
situation, there might be dozens, hundreds, or even thousands of images to 
process. To save us the tedium of running the Python program on each image,
we can construct a Bash shell script to run the program multiple times for us.
Here is a sample script, which assumes that the images all start with the
**trial-** prefix and end with the **.jpg** file extension. The script also
assumes that the images, the **RootMass.py** program, and the script itself
are all in the same directory. 

~~~
#!/bin/bash
# Run the root density mass on all of the root system trail images.

# first, remove existing binary output images
rm *-binary.jpg

# then, execute the program on all the trail images
for f in trial-*.jpg
do
	python RootMass.py $f 1.5
done
~~~
{: .bash}

The script begins by deleting any prior versions of the binary images. After
that, the script uses a `for` loop to iterate through all of the input images,
and execute the **RootMass.py** on each image with a sigma of 1.5.
When we execute the script from the command line, we will see output like this:

~~~
trial-016.jpg,0.0482436835106383
trial-020.jpg,0.06346941489361702
trial-216.jpg,0.14073969414893617
trial-293.jpg,0.13607895611702128
~~~
{: .output}

It would probably be wise to save the output of our multiple runs to a file 
that we can analyze later on. We can do that very easily by redirecting the
output stream that would normally appear on the screen to a file. Assuming the
shell script is named **rootmass.sh**, this would do the trick:

~~~
bash rootmass.sh > rootmass.csv
~~~
