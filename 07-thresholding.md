:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: questions

- How can we use thresholding to produce a binary image?

::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

In this episode, we will learn how to use scikit-image functions to apply
thresholding to an image.
Thresholding is a type of *image segmentation*,
where we change the pixels of an image to make the image easier to analyze.
In thresholding, we convert an image from colour or grayscale into
a *binary image*, i.e., one that is simply black and white.
Most frequently,
we use thresholding as a way to select areas of interest of an image,
while ignoring the parts we are not concerned with.
We have already done some simple thresholding,
in the "Manipulating pixels" section of
[the *Working with scikit-image* episode](03-skimage-images.md).
In that case, we used a simple NumPy array manipulation to
separate the pixels belonging to the root system of a plant from the black background.
In this episode, we will learn how to use scikit-image functions to perform thresholding.
Then, we will use the masks returned by these functions to
select the parts of an image we are interested in.

## First, import the packages needed for this episode

```python
import glob

import imageio.v3 as iio
import ipympl
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import numpy as np
import skimage as ski

%matplotlib widget
```

## Simple thresholding

Consider the image `data/shapes-01.jpg` with a series of
crudely cut shapes set against a white background.

```python
# load the image
shapes01 = iio.imread(uri="data/shapes-01.jpg")

fig, ax = plt.subplots()
ax.imshow(shapes01)
```

![](data/shapes-01.jpg){alt='Image with geometric shapes on white background' .image-with-shadow}

Now suppose we want to select only the shapes from the image.
In other words, we want to leave the pixels belonging to the shapes "on,"
while turning the rest of the pixels "off,"
by setting their colour channel values to zeros.
The scikit-image library has several different methods of thresholding.
We will start with the simplest version,
which involves an important step of human input.
Specifically, in this simple, *fixed-level thresholding*,
we have to provide a threshold value `t`.

The process works like this.
First, we will load the original image, convert it to grayscale,
and de-noise it as in [the *Blurring Images* episode](06-blurring.md).

```python
# convert the image to grayscale
gray_shapes = ski.color.rgb2gray(shapes01)

# blur the image to denoise
blurred_shapes = ski.filters.gaussian(gray_shapes, sigma=1.0)

fig, ax = plt.subplots()
ax.imshow(blurred_shapes, cmap="gray")
```

![](fig/shapes-01-grayscale.png){alt='Grayscale image of the geometric shapes' .image-with-shadow}

Next, we would like to apply the threshold `t` such that
pixels with grayscale values on one side of `t` will be turned "on",
while pixels with grayscale values on the other side will be turned "off".
How might we do that?
Remember that grayscale images contain pixel values in the range from 0 to 1,
so we are looking for a threshold `t` in the closed range [0\.0, 1.0].
We see in the image that the geometric shapes are "darker" than
the white background but there is also some light gray noise on the background.
One way to determine a "good" value for `t` is
to look at the grayscale histogram of the image
and try to identify what grayscale ranges correspond to the shapes in the image
or the background.

The histogram for the shapes image shown above can be produced as in
[the *Creating Histograms* episode](05-creating-histograms.md).

```python
# create a histogram of the blurred grayscale image
histogram, bin_edges = np.histogram(blurred_shapes, bins=256, range=(0.0, 1.0))

fig, ax = plt.subplots()
ax.plot(bin_edges[0:-1], histogram)
ax.set_title("Grayscale Histogram")
ax.set_xlabel("grayscale value")
ax.set_ylabel("pixels")
ax.set_xlim(0, 1.0)
```

![](fig/shapes-01-histogram.png){alt='Grayscale histogram of the geometric shapes image'}

Since the image has a white background,
most of the pixels in the image are white.
This corresponds nicely to what we see in the histogram:
there is a peak near the value of 1.0.
If we want to select the shapes and not the background,
we want to turn off the white background pixels,
while leaving the pixels for the shapes turned on.
So, we should choose a value of `t` somewhere before the large peak and
turn pixels above that value "off".
Let us choose `t=0.8`.

To apply the threshold `t`,
we can use the NumPy comparison operators to create a mask.
Here, we want to turn "on" all pixels which have values smaller than the threshold,
so we use the less operator `<` to compare the `blurred_image` to the threshold `t`.
The operator returns a mask, that we capture in the variable `binary_mask`.
It has only one channel, and each of its values is either 0 or 1.
The binary mask created by the thresholding operation can be shown with `ax.imshow`,
where the `False` entries are shown as black pixels
(0-valued) and the `True` entries are shown as white pixels
(1-valued).

```python
# create a mask based on the threshold
t = 0.8
binary_mask = blurred_shapes < t

fig, ax = plt.subplots()
ax.imshow(binary_mask, cmap="gray")
```

![](fig/shapes-01-mask.png){alt='Binary mask of the geometric shapes created by thresholding'}

You can see that the areas where the shapes were in the original area are now white,
while the rest of the mask image is black.

## What makes a good threshold?

As is often the case, the answer to this question is "it depends".
In the example above, we could have just switched off all
the white background pixels by choosing `t=1.0`,
but this would leave us with some background noise in the mask image.
On the other hand, if we choose too low a value for the threshold,
we could lose some of the shapes that are too bright.
You can experiment with the threshold by re-running the above code lines with
different values for `t`.
In practice, it is a matter of domain knowledge and
experience to interpret the peaks in the histogram so to determine
an appropriate threshold.
The process often involves trial and error,
which is a drawback of the simple thresholding method.
Below we will introduce automatic thresholding,
which uses a quantitative, mathematical definition for a good threshold that
allows us to determine the value of `t` automatically.
It is worth noting that the principle for simple and automatic thresholding
can also be used for images with pixel ranges other than [0\.0, 1.0].
For example, we could perform thresholding on pixel intensity values
in the range [0, 255] as we have already seen in
[the *Working with scikit-image* episode](03-skimage-images.md).


::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

We can now apply the `binary_mask` to the original coloured image as we
have learned in [the *Drawing and Bitwise Operations* episode](04-drawing.md).
What we are left with is only the coloured shapes from the original.

```python
# use the binary_mask to select the "interesting" part of the image
selection = shapes01.copy()
selection[~binary_mask] = 0

fig, ax = plt.subplots()
ax.imshow(selection)
```

![](fig/shapes-01-selected.png){alt='Selected shapes after applying binary mask'}

:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::  challenge

## More practice with simple thresholding (15 min)

Now, it is your turn to practice. Suppose we want to use simple thresholding
to select only the coloured shapes (in this particular case we consider grayish to be a colour, too) from the image `data/shapes-02.jpg`:

![](data/shapes-02.jpg){alt='Another image with geometric shapes on white background'}

First, plot the grayscale histogram as in the [Creating
Histogram](05-creating-histograms.md) episode and
examine the distribution of grayscale values in the image. What do
you think would be a good value for the threshold `t`?

:::::::::::::::  solution

## Solution

The histogram for the `data/shapes-02.jpg` image can be shown with

```python
shapes = iio.imread(uri="data/shapes-02.jpg")
gray_shapes = ski.color.rgb2gray(shapes)
histogram, bin_edges = np.histogram(gray_shapes, bins=256, range=(0.0, 1.0))

fig, ax = plt.subplots()
ax.plot(bin_edges[0:-1], histogram)
ax.set_title("Graylevel histogram")
ax.set_xlabel("gray value")
ax.set_ylabel("pixel count")
ax.set_xlim(0, 1.0)
```

![](fig/shapes-02-histogram.png){alt='Grayscale histogram of the second geometric shapes image'}

We can see a large spike around 0.3, and a smaller spike around 0.7. The
spike near 0.3 represents the darker background, so it seems like a value
close to `t=0.5` would be a good choice.


:::::::::::::::::::::::::

Next, create a mask to turn the pixels above the threshold `t` on
and pixels below the threshold `t` off. Note that unlike the image
with a white background we used above, here the peak for the
background colour is at a lower gray level than the
shapes. Therefore, change the comparison operator less `<` to
greater `>` to create the appropriate mask. Then apply the mask to
the image and view the thresholded image. If everything works as it
should, your output should show only the coloured shapes on a black
background.

:::::::::::::::  solution

## Solution

Here are the commands to create and view the binary mask

```python
t = 0.5
binary_mask = gray_shapes > t

fig, ax = plt.subplots()
ax.imshow(binary_mask, cmap="gray")
```

![](fig/shapes-02-mask.png){alt='Binary mask created by thresholding the second geometric shapes image'}

And here are the commands to apply the mask and view the thresholded image

```python
shapes02 = iio.imread(uri="data/shapes-02.jpg")
selection = shapes02.copy()
selection[~binary_mask] = 0

fig, ax = plt.subplots()
ax.imshow(selection)
```

![](fig/shapes-02-selected.png){alt='Selected shapes after applying binary mask to the second geometric shapes image'}

:::::::::::::::::::::::::

::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

## Automatic thresholding

The downside of the simple thresholding technique is that we have to
make an educated guess about the threshold `t` by inspecting the histogram.
There are also *automatic thresholding* methods that can determine
the threshold automatically for us.
One such method is *[Otsu's method](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Otsu%27s_method)*.
It is particularly useful for situations where the grayscale histogram of an image
has two peaks that correspond to background and objects of interest.

:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::  callout

## Denoising an image before thresholding

In practice, it is often necessary to denoise the image before
thresholding, which can be done with one of the methods from
[the *Blurring Images* episode](06-blurring.md).


::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

Consider the image `data/maize-root-cluster.jpg` of a maize root system which
we have seen before in
[the *Working with scikit-image* episode](03-skimage-images.md).

```python
maize_roots = iio.imread(uri="data/maize-root-cluster.jpg")

fig, ax = plt.subplots()
ax.imshow(maize_roots)
```

![](data/maize-root-cluster.jpg){alt='Image of a maize root'}

We use Gaussian blur with a sigma of 1.0 to denoise the root image.
Let us look at the grayscale histogram of the denoised image.

```python
# convert the image to grayscale
gray_image = ski.color.rgb2gray(maize_roots)

# blur the image to denoise
blurred_image = ski.filters.gaussian(gray_image, sigma=1.0)

# show the histogram of the blurred image
histogram, bin_edges = np.histogram(blurred_image, bins=256, range=(0.0, 1.0))
fig, ax = plt.subplots()
ax.plot(bin_edges[0:-1], histogram)
ax.set_title("Graylevel histogram")
ax.set_xlabel("gray value")
ax.set_ylabel("pixel count")
ax.set_xlim(0, 1.0)
```

![](fig/maize-root-cluster-histogram.png){alt='Grayscale histogram of the maize root image'}

The histogram has a significant peak around 0.2 and then a broader "hill" around 0.6 followed by a 
smaller peak near 1.0. Looking at the grayscale image, we can identify the peak at 0.2 with the
background and the broader peak with the foreground.
Thus, this image is a good candidate for thresholding with Otsu's method.
The mathematical details of how this works are complicated (see
[the scikit-image documentation](https://scikit-image.org/docs/dev/api/skimage.filters.html#threshold-otsu)
if you are interested),
but the outcome is that Otsu's method finds a threshold value between the two peaks of a grayscale
histogram which might correspond well to the foreground and background depending on the data and 
application.

:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: instructor

The histogram of the maize root image may prompt questions from learners about the interpretation 
of the peaks and the broader region around 0.6. The focus here is on the separation of background 
and foreground pixel values. We note that Otsu's method does not work well 
for the image with the shapes used earlier in this episode, as the foreground pixel values are more 
distributed. These examples could be augmented with a discussion of unimodal, bimodal, and multimodal
histograms. While these points can lead to fruitful considerations, the text in this episode attempts 
to reduce cognitive load and deliberately simplifies the discussion.

::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

The `ski.filters.threshold_otsu()` function can be used to determine
the threshold automatically via Otsu's method.
Then NumPy comparison operators can be used to apply it as before.
Here are the Python commands to determine the threshold `t` with Otsu's method.

```python
# perform automatic thresholding
t = ski.filters.threshold_otsu(blurred_image)
print("Found automatic threshold t = {}.".format(t))
```

```output
Found automatic threshold t = 0.4172454549881862.
```

For this root image and a Gaussian blur with the chosen sigma of 1.0,
the computed threshold value is 0.42.
No we can create a binary mask with the comparison operator `>`.
As we have seen before, pixels above the threshold value will be turned on,
those below the threshold will be turned off.

```python
# create a binary mask with the threshold found by Otsu's method
binary_mask = blurred_image > t

fig, ax = plt.subplots()
ax.imshow(binary_mask, cmap="gray")
```

![](fig/maize-root-cluster-mask.png){alt='Binary mask of the maize root system'}

Finally, we use the mask to select the foreground:

```python
# apply the binary mask to select the foreground
selection = maize_roots.copy()
selection[~binary_mask] = 0

fig, ax = plt.subplots()
ax.imshow(selection)
```

![](fig/maize-root-cluster-selected.png){alt='Masked selection of the maize root system'}

## Application: measuring root mass

Let us now turn to an application where we can apply thresholding and
other techniques we have learned to this point.
Consider these four maize root system images,
which you can find in the files
`data/trial-016.jpg`,
`data/trial-020.jpg`,
`data/trial-216.jpg`,
and `data/trial-293.jpg`.

![](fig/four-maize-roots.jpg){alt='Four images of maize roots'}

Suppose we are interested in the amount of plant material in each image,
and in particular how that amount changes from image to image.
Perhaps the images represent the growth of the plant over time,
or perhaps the images show four different maize varieties at the
same phase of their growth.
The question we would like to answer is, "how much root mass is in each image?"

We will first construct a Python program to measure this value for a single image.
Our strategy will be this:

1. Read the image, converting it to grayscale as it is read. For this
  application we do not need the colour image.
2. Blur the image.
3. Use Otsu's method of thresholding to create a binary image, where
  the pixels that were part of the maize plant are white, and everything
  else is black.
4. Save the binary image so it can be examined later.
5. Count the white pixels in the binary image, and divide by the
  number of pixels in the image. This ratio will be a measure of the
  root mass of the plant in the image.
6. Output the name of the image processed and the root mass ratio.

Our intent is to perform these steps and produce the numeric result -
a measure of the root mass in the image -
without human intervention.
Implementing the steps within a Python function will
enable us to call this function for different images.

Here is a Python function that implements this root-mass-measuring strategy.
Since the function is intended to produce numeric output without human interaction,
it does not display any of the images.
Almost all of the commands should be familiar, and in fact,
it may seem simpler than the code we have worked on thus far,
because we are not displaying any of the images.

```python
def measure_root_mass(filename, sigma=1.0):

    # read the original image, converting to grayscale on the fly
    image = iio.imread(uri=filename, mode="L")

    # blur before thresholding
    blurred_image = ski.filters.gaussian(image, sigma=sigma)

    # perform automatic thresholding to produce a binary image
    t = ski.filters.threshold_otsu(blurred_image)
    binary_mask = blurred_image > t

    # determine root mass ratio
    root_pixels = np.count_nonzero(binary_mask)
    density = root_pixels / binary_mask.size

    return density
```

The function begins with reading the original image from the file `filename`.
We use `iio.imread()` with the optional argument `mode="L"` to
automatically convert it to grayscale.
Next, the grayscale image is blurred with a Gaussian filter with
the value of `sigma` that is passed to the function.
Then we determine the threshold `t` with Otsu's method and
create a binary mask just as we did in the previous section.
Up to this point, everything should be familiar.

The final part of the function determines the root mass ratio in the image.
Recall that in the `binary_mask`, every pixel has either a value of
zero (black/background) or one (white/foreground).
We want to count the number of white pixels,
which can be accomplished with a call to the NumPy function `np.count_nonzero`.
Finally, the density ratio is calculated by dividing the number of white pixels
by the total number of pixels `binary_mask.size` in the image.
The function returns then root density of the image.

We can call this function with any filename and
provide a sigma value for the blurring.
If no sigma value is provided, the default value 1.0 will be used.
For example, for the file `data/trial-016.jpg` and a sigma value of 1.5,
we would call the function like this:

```python
measure_root_mass(filename="data/trial-016.jpg", sigma=1.5)
```

```output
0.0482436835106383`
```

Now we can use the function to process the series of four images shown above.
In a real-world scientific situation, there might be dozens, hundreds,
or even thousands of images to process.
To save us the tedium of calling the function for each image by hand,
we can write a loop that processes all files automatically.
The following code block assumes that the files are located in the same directory
and the filenames all start with the **trial-** prefix and
end with the **.jpg** suffix.

```python
all_files = glob.glob("data/trial-*.jpg")
for filename in all_files:
    density = measure_root_mass(filename=filename, sigma=1.5)
    # output in format suitable for .csv
    print(filename, density, sep=",")
```

```output
data/trial-016.jpg,0.0482436835106383
data/trial-020.jpg,0.06346941489361702
data/trial-216.jpg,0.14073969414893617
data/trial-293.jpg,0.13607895611702128
```

:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::  challenge

## Ignoring more of the images -- brainstorming (10 min)

Let us take a closer look at the binary masks produced by the `measure_root_mass` function.

![](fig/four-maize-roots-binary.jpg){alt='Binary masks of the four maize root images'}

You may have noticed in the section on automatic thresholding that
the thresholded image does include regions of the image aside of the
plant root: the numbered labels and the white circles in each image
are preserved during the thresholding, because their grayscale
values are above the threshold.
Therefore, our calculated root mass ratios include the white pixels
of the label and white circle that are not part of the plant root.
Those extra pixels affect how accurate the root mass calculation is!

How might we remove the labels and circles before calculating the ratio,
so that our results are more accurate?
Think about some options given what we have learned so far.

:::::::::::::::  solution

## Solution

One approach we might take is to try to completely mask out a region
from each image, particularly,
the area containing the white circle and the numbered label.
If we had coordinates for a rectangular area on the image
that contained the circle and the label,
we could mask the area out by using techniques we learned in
[the *Drawing and Bitwise Operations* episode](04-drawing.md).

However, a closer inspection of the binary images raises some issues with
that approach.
Since the roots are not always constrained to a certain area in the image,
and since the circles and labels are in different locations each time,
we would have difficulties coming up with a single rectangle that would
work for *every* image.
We could create a different masking rectangle for each image,
but that is not a practicable approach
if we have hundreds or thousands of images to process.

Another approach we could take is
to apply two thresholding steps to the image.
Look at the graylevel histogram of the file `data/trial-016.jpg` shown
above again:
Notice the peak near 1.0?
Recall that a grayscale value of 1.0 corresponds to white pixels:
the peak corresponds to the white label and circle.
So, we could use simple binary thresholding to mask the white circle and
label from the image,
and then we could use Otsu's method to select the pixels in
the plant portion of the image.

Note that most of this extra work in processing the image could have been
avoided during the experimental design stage,
with some careful consideration of how the resulting images would be used.
For example, all of the following measures could have made the images easier
to process, by helping us predict and/or detect where the label is in the image
and subsequently mask it from further processing:

- Using labels with a consistent size and shape
- Placing all the labels in the same position, relative to the sample
- Using a non-white label, with non-black writing

:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::  challenge

## Ignoring more of the images -- implementation (30 min - optional, not included in timing)

Implement an enhanced version of the function `measure_root_mass`
that applies simple binary thresholding to remove the white circle
and label from the image before applying Otsu's method.

:::::::::::::::  solution

## Solution

We can apply a simple binary thresholding with a threshold
`t=0.95` to remove the label and circle from the image. We can then use the
binary mask to calculate the Otsu threshold without the pixels from the label and circle.

```python
def enhanced_root_mass(filename, sigma):

    # read the original image, converting to grayscale on the fly
    image = iio.imread(uri=filename, mode="L")

    # blur before thresholding
    blurred_image = ski.filters.gaussian(image, sigma=sigma)

    # perform binary thresholding to mask the white label and circle
    binary_mask = blurred_image < 0.95
    
    # perform automatic thresholding using only the pixels with value True in the binary mask
    t = ski.filters.threshold_otsu(blurred_image[binary_mask])
    
    # update binary mask to identify pixels which are both less than 0.95 and greater than t
    binary_mask = (blurred_image < 0.95) & (blurred_image > t)

    # determine root mass ratio
    root_pixels = np.count_nonzero(binary_mask)
    density = root_pixels / binary_mask.size

    return density


all_files = glob.glob("data/trial-*.jpg")
for filename in all_files:
    density = enhanced_root_mass(filename=filename, sigma=1.5)
    # output in format suitable for .csv
    print(filename, density, sep=",")
```

The output of the improved program does illustrate that the white circles
and labels were skewing our root mass ratios:

```output
data/trial-016.jpg,0.046250166223404256
data/trial-020.jpg,0.05886968085106383
data/trial-216.jpg,0.13712117686170214
data/trial-293.jpg,0.13190342420212767
```
:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: spoiler

### What is `&` doing in the example above?

The `&` operator above means that we have defined a logical AND statement. This combines the two tests of pixel intensities in the blurred image such that both must be true for a pixel's position to be set to `True` in the resulting mask.

| Result of `t < blurred_image` | Result of `blurred_image < 0.95` | Resulting value in `binary_mask` |
|----------|---------|---------|
| False | True | False |
| True | False | False |
| True | True | True |
 
Knowing how to construct this kind of logical operation can be very helpful in image processing. The University of Minnesota Library's [guide to Boolean operators](https://libguides.umn.edu/BooleanOperators) is a good place to start if you want to learn more.

::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

Here are the binary images produced by the additional thresholding.
Note that we have not completely removed the offending white pixels.
Outlines still remain.
However, we have reduced the number of extraneous pixels,
which should make the output more accurate.

## Thresholding a bacteria colony image (15 min)

In the images directory `data/`, you will find an image named `colonies-01.tif`.

![](fig/colonies-01.jpg){alt='Image of bacteria colonies in a petri dish'}

This is one of the images you will be working with in the
morphometric challenge at the end of the workshop.

1. Plot and inspect the grayscale histogram of the image to
  determine a good threshold value for the image.
2. Create a binary mask that leaves the pixels in the bacteria
  colonies "on" while turning the rest of the pixels in the image
  "off".

:::::::::::::::  solution

## Solution

Here is the code to create the grayscale histogram:

```python
bacteria = iio.imread(uri="data/colonies-01.tif")
gray_image = ski.color.rgb2gray(bacteria)
blurred_image = ski.filters.gaussian(gray_image, sigma=1.0)
histogram, bin_edges = np.histogram(blurred_image, bins=256, range=(0.0, 1.0))
fig, ax = plt.subplots()
ax.plot(bin_edges[0:-1], histogram)
ax.set_title("Graylevel histogram")
ax.set_xlabel("gray value")
ax.set_ylabel("pixel count")
ax.set_xlim(0, 1.0)
```

![](fig/colonies-01-histogram.png){alt='Grayscale histogram of the bacteria colonies image'}

The peak near one corresponds to the white image background,
and the broader peak around 0.5 corresponds to the yellow/brown
culture medium in the dish.
The small peak near zero is what we are after: the dark bacteria colonies.
A reasonable choice thus might be to leave pixels below `t=0.2` on.

Here is the code to create and show the binarized image using the
`<` operator with a threshold `t=0.2`:

```python
t = 0.2
binary_mask = blurred_image < t

fig, ax = plt.subplots()
ax.imshow(binary_mask, cmap="gray")
```

![](fig/colonies-01-mask.png){alt='Binary mask of the bacteria colonies image'}

When you experiment with the threshold a bit, you can see that in
particular the size of the bacteria colony near the edge of the
dish in the top right is affected by the choice of the threshold.

- Thresholding produces a binary image, where all pixels with intensities above (or below) a threshold value are turned on, while all other pixels are turned off.
- The binary images produced by thresholding are held in two-dimensional NumPy arrays, since they have only one colour value channel. They are boolean, hence they contain the values 0 (off) and 1 (on).
- Thresholding can be used to create masks that select only the interesting parts of an image, or as the first step before edge detection or finding contours.
